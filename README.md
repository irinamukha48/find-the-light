# Find the Light
This is Irina Mukhametzhanova's submission for HackPHS 2019

Find the Light is a game in which you go around a randomly generated room and try to touch the star, which allows you to progress to the next level.

# Why this idea?
I want to become involved in game development in the future, and this hackathon has presented an opportunity... with a deadline.

# How does it work?
It generates random levels using random walk (aka drunkard's walk). It takes one "step" in a random direction at a time, this making a path, or, in this case, a room. The separate file levels.py is responsible for generating those levels.

# Instructions
To run this program, you need to have pygame installed. Run the findTheLight.py file. Control the character with arrow keys.
